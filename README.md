# Bibliographic Database Project
## Description
A bibliographical database is an electronic archive of bibliographic references that can
 be dynamically interrogated. Typically, it contains only citations of articles, often with
 abstracts, with a link to the full text version of the articles or their localization. Compared
 to a search conducted on a generic engine, a database offers numerous advantages in
 the quality and quantity of the results obtainable.
